This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: a missing return statement in a function that leads to unexpected behavior. The function `my_function` calculates the square of a number, but it lacks a return statement for the case when the input is 0. This results in an implicit return of `nothing`, which is not always what is expected.  The solution shows how to add a return statement to handle all possible cases, ensuring the function always returns a value.
